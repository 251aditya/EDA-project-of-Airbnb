## Introduction
The "AirBnB Booking Analysis" project focuses on exploring and analyzing the booking data of AirBnB rentals to gain valuable insights into the trends, patterns, and factors influencing the booking process. Airbnb is a popular online marketplace that connects travelers with hosts who offer unique lodging options around the world.
I have conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Airbnb NYC 2019 data to gain insights into the Airbnb market in New York City.

By conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on this data, our goal is to understand the preferences of travelers and hosts, identify peak booking seasons, and discover interesting correlations between various attributes and booking trends. It empowers travelers to make informed choices when selecting AirBnB accommodations that best align with their preferences and requirements.
